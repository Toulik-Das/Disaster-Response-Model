# Overview 

Your project I build a web app where an emergency worker or NGOs can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. In this project,I used disaster data from [Figure Eight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_Eight_Inc.) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages which implemented in the web app.
